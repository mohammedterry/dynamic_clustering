# dynamic_clustering

Advantage:  Automatically determines number of clusters 
Hyperparameters:  Neighbourhood Radius, step size

Idea:  all datapoints move toward the centroid of their local neighbourhood of datapoints using a small stepsize.   Repeat until all datapoints converge to clusters.  The datapoints move position
